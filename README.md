### Short Abstract:

MaxPooling in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) is not trivial; it isn't a regular
max() operation. This paper proposes two different methods of implementing
MaxPooling in SNNs - called **AVAM** and **MJOP** Spiking-MaxPooling, both of
which are entirely deployable on Loihi neuromorphic hardware.

## Misc
A tutorial on the introduction to MJOP and AVAM methods and how to use it in
your SNNs can be found here. Also, feel free to use the code in this repository.
