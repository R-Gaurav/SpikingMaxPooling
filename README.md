### Short Abstract:

MaxPooling in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) is not trivial; it isn't a regular
max() operation. This paper proposes two different methods of implementing
MaxPooling in SNNs - called **AVAM** and **MJOP** Spiking-MaxPooling, both of
which are entirely deployable on Loihi neuromorphic hardware.

## Misc
A tutorial on the introduction to **MJOP** and **AVAM** methods can be found
[here](https://r-gaurav.github.io/2022/05/22/Spiking-Max-Pooling-in-Convolutional-Spiking-Neural-Networks.html). Feel free to use the code in this repository.
