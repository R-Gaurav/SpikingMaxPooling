    "The idea for max pooling is to maintain a running estimate of Inter Spike Intervals (ISI) and take minimum of each ensemble's (where each ensemble is composed of just one neuron) ISI at every timestep. The ensemble with minimum ISI would be representing the max value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, one does not need to keep a running estimate of min ISI; rather in first few timesteps (say 5 to 10 timesteps) one can accurately (or close to it) determine the min ISI, since the spiking pattern remains consistent throughout the simulation. For the ones, whose min ISI couldn't be determined in first few timesteps, a default of AveragePooling filter can be used, or a Winner Take All (based on first spike) method can also be used - depending on the depth of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below lies the exact implementation of my algorithm for determining the max value in the input of 4 scalars. Each input ensemble is composed of just one neuron. Four input nodes are connected to the individual ensembles and then a 4D `max_node` receives spiking input from the four ensmebles, thereby calculating the `max_pool_mask` to output the spikes of the maximally spiking ensemble (i.e. the maximally spiking neuron)."
